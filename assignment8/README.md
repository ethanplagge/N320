# assignment_8

- For this assignment, after doing some research about transferring data between components, the web had mentioned that I should try using VueX, something I had never heard of.
- After some research, I was able to utilize it for this assignment and it works pretty seamlessly.
- I did have a couple of hiccups along the process, for whatever reason I found a bug that you must complete your personal information and hit the "Submit Info" button before selecting team members.
